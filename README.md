This is the primary repo for my battle royale coding game

## TODO

* [x] set up bot to move randomly after the initial turn
* [ ] decide if first turn has bots randomly placed or get to choose
* [ ] refactor bot to use move strings (up, left, etc.) on subsequent turns
* [ ] make first turn in bot really random
* [x] increment turns so not always turn 0
* [ ] refactor vector of bots to be a hashmap with id as key and bot as the value
